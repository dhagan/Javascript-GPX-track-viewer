In browser GPX viewer using file api in javascript
===

- drag .gpx file into browser window
- track shows on map
- all parsing is done in browser, nothing gets sent to server
- you get altitude chart and slope/speed bubble chart colored by which fifth of track the data point belongs to (I wanted to see how speed depends on slope and how much I lose energy during race - but it would need more programming to get a better visualisation for this)
